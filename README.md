### Notes
    - I do not know why, but the main label automatically changes to whatever is typed into the 
      textField without the Rename button being pressed
    - While testing the app, I could not get the keyboard to go away so I decided to add code that dismissed the 
      keyboard when you touch the view (reset).
    - I had extreme trouble running the simulator, and I never got it to work. Instead, I had to
      run/test the app on my phone. This led to some complications while making the app 
      walkthrough gif.
    - The "Underworld" button that changes the background view also changes the color of two of the other buttons,
      but I could not get it to change the color of the "Underworld" button and I do not know why.
    - In an effort to show all of the features in the least time possible, the gif seems slightly rushed.
