### Notes
    - I do not know why, but the label automatically changes to whatever is typed into the 
      textField without the Rename button being pressed
    - I had extreme trouble running the simulator, and I never got it to work. Instead, I had to
      run the app on my phone, which is led to even more complications on how to make the app 
      walkthrough gif.
    - The button that changes the background view also changes the color of two of the buttons,
      but I could not get it to change the color of the button that is pressed. I do not know why.
